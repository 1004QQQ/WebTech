        <!--Using the semantic tag <strong> because the requirement states "marks up important text" and not simply bold it for asthetic reasons, therefore I choose <strong> as it is used for strongly important text.-->

    <p>
        The most <em>"research"</em> related to the Web I've ever done before this class was occasionally getting into the "Inspect" button in random websites to change text or trying to bypass the paywall in articles. It didn't work, but the text changes were funny. However, I do look forward to properly learn web design. I've been learning html and it is fun.
        <br>
        Anyway, here are some random web quotes I found from Shape:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="Academic" cite="https://madebyshape.co.uk/web-design-blog/inspirational-design-quotes-for-web-designers-and-graphic-designers/">
        <p>
            “If you think math is hard, try web design.” <br>“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”<br> “If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.”
        </p>
