    <h1>INST0007: Web Techhnologies</h1>
    <p>This page highlights the techonologies, languages and frameworks I want to learn in this module.</p>
    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>Here are the technologies I would like to learn more about</p>
    <h3>HTTP</h3>
    <p>HTTP is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</p>
    <h3>Web Server</h3>
    <p>Web Server, is commonly a piece of software that enables the server (as a device) to locate and send resources to the client.</p>
    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <p>Languages I would like to learn more about</p>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>Programming is interesting and Python seems like everyone's go-to to start with.</p>
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p>Interactive websites were always the most fun so I'd like to learn how to do that as well.</p>
    <!-- Hmmm should I add XML? The custom tags feature seems pretty useful...-->
    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Frameworks I would like to learn more about</p>
    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p>I was not aware of any frameworks but this one's name is funny. Seems to be a CSS framework that helps with responsive and mobile-first websites.</p>
    <h3>Ionic</h3>
    <p>Another framework, a development platform. Cool.</p>
